### Welcome! 👋

My name is Sophie Breitbart. 👩‍🦰 I'm kind of an ecological software developer now?! Officially, I am a contractor who works in support of NOAA Fisheries. My main goal is to help develop two R packages ([asar](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/asar/) and [satf](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/satf)) that will allow fisheries scientists to write their [stock assessment reports](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/population-assessments/fish-stock-assessment-report) more reproducibly and efficiently. These reports can be hundreds of pages log and include dozens of figures and tables. It's been an amazing experience to learn from brilliant fisheries scientists and build the skills needed to develop R packages! Before this, I received my PhD in 2024 from the University of Toronto in the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: tasks related to my job. But also, learning how to adjust to 100% remote work. Standing desk: check! 🙂
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: New skills left and right! In addition to general R coding and package architecture skills, I've been learning how to increase accessibility of reports by, for instance, providing alternative text and tagging. Also, skills like writing unit tests and collaborating through GitHub.
