### Welcome! 👋

My name is Sophie Breitbart. 👩‍🦰 I'm a new PhD from the University of Toronto in the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: Publishing my last thesis chapter before beginning my new job (TBA!). Previously, I worked on understanding how urbanization influences the ecology and evolution of common milkweed (a favorite of Monarch butterflies).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: New skills left and right! My thesis has allowed me to cultivate skills in field research, statistics and modelling, teaching, writing, data analysis, bioinformatics and genomics, storytelling through presentations and [other](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/446efee44f8d49578d3c62bfe2c25fc1) [formats](https://spv2p2-sophie-breitbart.shinyapps.io/ebird_dashboard2/), molecular analyses, and so much more. I owe a lot to my excellent advisors, Drs. Marc Johnson and Helene Wagner.
